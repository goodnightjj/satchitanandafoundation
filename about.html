				<h3>Spread freedom across the globe</h3>
				<p>Specifically by 2050 US governance returns to its founding principles of protecting our inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and inspires countries across the developing world to adopt the same.</p>
				<h3>Foster flourishing and spiritual awakening</h3>
				<p>Specifically by 2050 all beings have access to support with mental health challenges and our global education system fosters a sense of inclusiveness and personal responsibilityâ€”the foundations of inner freedom.</p>
